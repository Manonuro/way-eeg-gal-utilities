The WAY-EEG-GAL data files can be found on FigShare.
http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.988376 

Please ensure the WAY-EEG-GAL data files are unzipped into a set of directories 'P1', 'P2', â€¦, 'P12'.  A directory 'PX' contains the data of participant X, unzipped from PX.zip. There must also be a directory 'Utilities'.  All directories should be on the same level.

The scripts in Utilities can be used with either Matlab or Octave.  From within Matlab/Octave usage notes for each script can be seen with the command 'help' followed by the script's name.  

If you use Octave, you will require the 'signal' package.  

To make use of the WEEG_MakeEEGLABDataset.m script, you will need EEGLAB (WEEG_HowToGenerateERSP.txt gives information on how to generate ERSP plots in EEGLAB)  
EEGLAB can be downloaded from http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/

Unfortunately, EEGLAB does not work with Octave.
