How to use EEGLAB to generate ERSP images for a certain event 
over all trials for one participant.

1. Open EEGLAB.

2. Run WEEG_MakeEEGLABDatasets.m for the participant 
you are interested in.  This will generate 9 .fdt and .set files.

3. File -> Load existing dataset.  
Select ALL 9 .set files.

4. Edit -> Append dataset, enter indices 1 through 9 
(or whichever indices correspond to the datasets in EEGLAB - 
you can see this under the Dataset menu),
e.g., 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Now you have a single dataset with all trials 
for this participant, notated with events.  

You can single out a particular event as follows (i.e., for ERSP).

5. Tools -> Extract Epochs.  Click the button 
next to the first row, then select the event you are interested in. 
Select the desired time interval (with the event always at 0 ms) 
in the second row.  You will also have to enter the baseline latency range.   
Another EEGLAB dataset will be generated, with epoched windows around 
only the event you are interested in.

6. Plot -> Channel ERP image.  Enter the EEG channel you want 
(refer to EEG_Electrode_Numbering.jpg).  Select the event you used 
to create epochs in "event type(s)" and select "type" 
in the "epoch-sorting field" box.  Enter the frequency range 
in the two left boxes under "sort trials by phase" and 
"inter-trial coherence options".  Enter a significance level 
(e.g., 0.05), and check "image amps).  Click the button at the 
bottom right to generate the result.
